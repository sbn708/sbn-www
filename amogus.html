        <p>In November 2020, LavaMeteor posted this cursed FaceApp edit of Evil Jerma on the Jerma subreddit. Eventually, One Guy gave it the caption "When the impostor is sus! ðŸ˜³" and made Jerma open it on stream (Bugsnax 11-14-2020), exposing it to his thousands of adoring fans. The caption is a reference to the hit multiplayer game Among Us, referring to a moment where the player who is the Imposter is acting suspicious. For some reason, the image spread like wildfire and soon became popular for a couple of weeks, which is the usual lifespan of memes post-2010. At one point, the r/AmongUs subreddit got so overwhelmed by users spamming JermaSus that the mods banned the image and even shut down the subreddit for a while.<br><br>Jerma stated during the F.E.A.R. 2 stream that he had wished for Evil Jerma to be outstripped in popularity, stating that it was the one photo of his face that he hated more than any other. He then went onto remark how the Monkey's Paw must have curled, spawning the infinitely worse but also infinitely more popular image of JermaSus.<br><br>The meme has mutated well beyond the popularity of Jerma's circle of influence, being used as an ironic shitpost to mock Among Us, with the exaggerated, disturbing smile representing the Among Us fandom's perceived obsession with the game and the ridiculous emotional effect it has on them.</p>
